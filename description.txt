Inspired by the 'Nightmare Behind You' and 'Radiance Barrage' mods for Hollow knight, the Boss Barrages mod makes it so that, after a certain amount of time, a certain boss will appear and use an attack on you. You can configure what bosses attack, when they attack, and how hard they hit in the mod's configuration settings.
This mod is meant to add a challenge to your playthrough/add a challenge to a specific boss fight. Be sure to check out the homepage for more info! NOTE: For anything to occur you have to enable at least one of the mod's configuration settings.
